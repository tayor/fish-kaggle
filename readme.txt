Application of Transfer Learning using  "The Nature Conservancy Fisheries Monitoring" dataset

fish_cnn.py -> CNN model

fish_bottleneck.py -> bottleneck features of a pre-trained network i.e. VGG16 model

fish_finetune.py -> Fine-tuning the top layers of a a pre-trained network

fish_rnn.py -> RNN - LSTM for image classification - moved up 40 places

fish_crnn.py -> CNN + LSTM for image classification - moved up 176 places
